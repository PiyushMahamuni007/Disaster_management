                    <p>
                        The tsunami definition states that “A series of waves triggered by the movement of a large
                        amount of water in a water body, typically an ocean or a large lake” <br>


                        The tsunami definition tells us that these are waves so tsunamis are also known as tidal waves.
                        Tsunamis and tides both create inland water waves, but the inland movement of water in the case
                        of a tsunami can be much greater, giving the appearance of an extremely high and strong tide
                        called a tsunami wave. <br>
                        In this article on tsunamis, we will learn about the causes and effects of tsunamis, types of
                        tsunamis, and more tsunami information. <br>

                    <h3>What is the Spelling of the Tsunami?</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>Tsunami is derived from the Japanese word “soo-NAH-mee”. The tsunami meaning in Japanese is
                        “harbour wave”. Since in Japanese words, there is no ‘T’. So when spelt the initial 'T' is often
                        silent which fits with the phonological rules of English. <br>


                        So, the correct spelling of Tsunami is “Tsunami” with ‘T’ a silent letter.</p><br>

                    <p>
                    <h2 class="text-primary">Types of Tsunami</h2><br>
                    There are three basic types of tsunami that occur worldwide. Let us discuss in detail the types of
                    tsunamis in this article on tsunami. <br>
                    <h3 class="text-primary-emphasis">Local Tsunami</h3><br>
                    <p>A local tsunami is one that causes damage in close proximity to the event that triggered the
                        tsunami. <br>

                        The underwater occurrence, which is typically an earthquake that triggers a local tsunami,
                        occurs within 100 kilometres (just over 60 miles) of the land damage that results. <br>

                        Since the time between the underwater occurrence and the arrival of the tsunami can be less than
                        an hour, and even less than 10 minutes, these tsunamis can be catastrophic. <br>

                        There is insufficient time to perform a thorough evacuation.</p><br>
                    <h3 class="text-primary-emphasis">Regional Tsunami</h3><br>
                    <p>A regional tsunami is described as one that causes damage between 100 and 1,000 kilometres from
                        the source of the tsunami. Outside the 1,000-kilometer perimeter, more contained damages will
                        occur in some cases. <br>

                        Regional tsunamis have a significantly longer warning time than local tsunamis, arriving between
                        one and three hours after the triggering incident. <br>

                        Within a 1,000-kilometer radius, one to three hours might not be enough time for people to
                        safely evacuate. <br></p>
                    <h3 class="text-primary-emphasis">Distant Tsunami</h3><br>
                    <p>A distant tsunami, also known as a Teletsunami or ocean-wide tsunami, is caused by a strong and
                        devastating occurrence that occurs more than 1,000 kilometres away from landfall. <br>

                        A distant tsunami may appear to be a local tsunami at first, but it spreads through vast swaths
                        of the ocean basin. <br>

                        A distant tsunami allows more time to evacuate and flee, but it also occupies a wider area of
                        land and is more likely to cause extensive and widespread damage. <br></p>

                    <p>
                        <li>Tsunamis may be caused by earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and other underwater explosions
                            such as detonations, landslides, glacier calvings, meteorite impacts, and other man-made
                            disruptions above or below water.</li><br>
                        <li>The movement of a large amount of water or the perturbation of the sea is the primary cause
                            of a tsunami. Earthquakes, landslides, volcanic eruptions, ice calvings, and, more rarely,
                            meteorites and nuclear tests are all accounted for the water displacement. </li><br>
                        <li>Earthquakes are the major cause of tsunamis that occur worldwide.</li><br>
                        <li>Let us look into a detailed explanation of tsunami causes.</li><br>
                    </p>
                    <hr>
                    <li class="text-warning-emphasis">1] The Tsunami Caused By Earthquake</li><br>
                    When the seafloor suddenly deforms and vertically displaces the overlying water, tsunamis may occur.
                    <br>
                    Tectonic earthquakes are a type of earthquake that is related to the deformation of the Earth's
                    crust. <br>When these earthquakes happen under the sea, the water above the deformed region is
                    displaced from its equilibrium state. <br>
                    Because of the vertical component of movement involved, a tsunami can be produced when thrust
                    faults associated with convergent or destructive plate boundaries move suddenly, resulting in water
                    displacement. <br>
                    Tsunamis have a small wave height offshore and a long wavelength, which is why they go unnoticed
                    at sea, creating just a small swell about 300 mm (12 in) above the normal sea level. <br>
                    When they enter shallow water, they rise in height, a process known as wave shoaling. A tsunami
                    can occur at any tidal state, and coastal areas can be inundated even at low tide. <br>

                    Landslides cause displacements mostly along the shallower sections of the coastline, and the extent
                    of large landslides that hit the water is uncertain. <br>
                    Water in enclosed bays and lakes has been shown to be disturbed as a result, but no landslide large
                    enough to cause a transoceanic tsunami has ever occurred in recorded history. <br>

                    <li class="text-warning-emphasis"> 3] The Tsunami Caused By Meteorological Conditions</li><br>
                    The tsunami caused due to Meteorological changes is called a Meteotsunami. <br>
                    Rapid changes in barometric pressure, such as those seen when a front passes through, can displace
                    bodies of water enough to cause trains of waves with wavelengths similar to seismic tsunamis, but
                    with lower energies. <br>
                    These are basically dynamically similar to seismic tsunamis, with the exception that Meteotsunami
                    lacks the transoceanic scope of substantial seismic tsunamis and that the force that displaces the
                    water is maintained over time, preventing Meteotsunami from being modelled as occurring instantly.
                    <br>
                    Despite their lower energies, they can be strong enough to cause localised damage and loss of life
                    on shorelines where they can be intensified by resonance. <br>

                        <p>
                            <li>Till now we have learned about what is a Tsunami and the types of the tsunami. So in
                                this section, we will learn about the effects of the tsunami.</li><br>
                            <li> A tsunami's impact on a coastline can vary from mild to catastrophic. The
                                characteristics of the seismic event that caused the tsunami, its distance from its
                                point of origin, its duration, and, finally, the structure of the depth of water in
                                oceans along the coast that the tsunami is approaching, all influence the effects of the
                                tsunami.</li><br>
                            <li>Here let us discuss a few of the catastrophic effects on nature, animals, and humans.

                        <p>
                            <li>When a massive tsunami hits land, the amount of energy and water stored in it will cause
                                massive damage.</li><br>
                            <li>Tsunamis inflict damage by two mechanisms: the slamming force of a fast-moving wall of
                                water, and the destructive strength of a large volume of water draining off the ground
                                and bringing a large amount of debris with it, even with small waves.</li><br>
                            <li>The initial wave of a large tsunami is extremely high, but it does not cause the
                                majority of the damage. The vast mass of water behind the initial wavefront causes the
                                majority of the damage, as the sea level continues to rise rapidly and floods the
                                coastal region. </li><br>
                            <li>The strength of the waves, the never-ending crashing water, is what causes destruction
                                and death. A tsunami's huge breaking waves will kill everything in their way as they
                                pound the shoreline.
                            </li><br>
                            <li>Tsunami waves wreck everything in their path: boats, houses, bridges, vehicles, trees,
                                telephone lines, power lines, and just about everything else. </li><br>
                            <li>Some tsunamis have also made some of the small islands unrecognisable.</li><br>
                            <li>If the tsunami waves have swept away the shoreline's infrastructure, they will proceed
                                inland for several miles, sweeping away more trees, houses, vehicles, and other man-made
                                objects. </li><br>
