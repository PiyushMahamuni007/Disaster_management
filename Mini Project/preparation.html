                        <div><strong>Things You Need:</strong></div>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong></strong>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Water</span> - You need
                                clean safe water to drink. Store 1 gallon per day for each person in your home for
                                drinking and cooking. Experts say it is best to plan for three days. You can buy bottled
                                water from the grocery store or bottle it yourself. If you bottle it yourself, choose a
                                clean washed container like a soda bottle. Add four drops bleach (sodium hypochlorite)
                                per quart of water. Don’t use the scented bleaches. You may also need water to flush the
                                toilet if your home has a well with an electric pump. If you have any warning time
                                before the power goes off, run your bathtub and your washing machine full of water for
                                flushing the toilet. To flush the toilet when the power is off, just remove the tank lid
                                and fill the tank with water. Now flush and the tank will empty as the water goes out of
                                the bowel. Fill the tank back up for the next trip.</li>
                            <li><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Food </span>- You will need food that will not
                                spoil or go bad if it is not kept cold. Have several days worth of canned foods on hand
                                that could be eaten without heating if need be. Keep some foods that will keep for
                                several days without heat or cold. Have on hand foods like peanut butter, crackers,
                                fruit, vegetables, bread, and cereal. Food in your refrigerator and freezer will keep
                                for a while depending on many factors. Keep the door closed as much as possible.
                                Remember that you can cook on an outdoor grill if the weather is safe but you must do it
                                outdoors.</li>
                            <li><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Shelter</span> - Staying dry and warm is most
                                important in the case of winter storms. If your home has a safe fireplace, you have a
                                good source of warmth for your family. Keep a stack of dry firewood in preparation for
                                storm-related power failure. Gas logs will also work without power. Keep warm by
                                dressing in layers. Wrap up in blankets for sleeping or sitting still. If you get wet,
                                get dry as soon as possible. Make sure that your feet and hands stay warm and dry and
                                check the hands and feet of children and older folks.</li>
                            <li><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Transportation </span>- In case of emergency,
                                you need to be able to get to help, or get a message to help so that they can get you.
                                If it is safe to drive your car, help is available at your community fire department. A
                                Deputy Sheriff will be stationed at fire departments when communications lines are down.
                                If you have to walk to help, remember to take care of yourself so you don’t become the
                                victim instead of the rescuer. Dress in layers, take water and food, and take the safest
                                route even if it may take longer.</li>
                            <li><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Radio </span>- Most radio stations will
                                broadcast even if your home power is off. Keep a battery powered radio available with
                                extra batteries to receive emergency information.</li>
